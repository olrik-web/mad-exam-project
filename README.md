Calm Cuisine is a 3D mobile game created using Unity and C#. It was a project for my Mobile Application Development class at Business Academy Aarhus. 

## Description :page_facing_up:

Calm Cuisine is a game where you play as a chef who has to prepare food for customers. The restaurant is a 3D environment where you can move around and interact with objects. You can even buy new furniture for your restaurant. It is meant to be a relaxing game where you can just chill and cook food. It is developed for mobile devices and utilizes touch controls. 

## How to play :video_game:

The game is played by using the touch screen. You can move around by using the virtual joystick. You can interact with objects by tapping the "Interact" button. You can also use the "Pause" button to pause the game. By swiping you can change the camera position and by pinching you can zoom in and out.
